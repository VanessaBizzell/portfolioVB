Project Brief: 
The important factor for this project is to do this with raw HTML, CSS and Javascript (there are
other tools to help). Although using a system like wordpress has itâ€™s advantages, remember this
is all about demonstrating your skill!

1. Create a design. Plan it on paper or in a graphics package. Think about layout in terms
of boxes (an instructor can help you get started with this). It is important to do this before
you start to code!
2. Create a simple HTML starter file and add in tailwind. This
gives you some tools and functionality to rapidly create a good looking site (even if your
design skills are not great). 
3. Create a single index.html file with an opening statement about you and who you are.
You will also need to decide before completing this what other pages you will have in
your site (as you will need to create a menu system). Try to avoid creating other pages
until the index page is as solid as you can make it, as then you can copy it as the basis
for other pages.
4. Add pages for each of the projects you have completed so far. Include some description
of what your project does and why you have approached it the way that you have. Link
to the gitHub repository for your project and a live demo (GitHub Pages).
5. You will need to ensure that images used are free from copyright restrictions as you are
going to publish this live on the internet!
6. Optional: Purchase a domain name and hosting. There is plenty around and for strict
html hosting you do not need anything special, simple FTP upload (or upload via a
dashboard) is sufficient. Try looking at 123-reg.co.uk, fasthosts.co.uk or google UK web
hosting.
